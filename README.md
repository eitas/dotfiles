# dotfiles

Adding a README.  This will replace the previous dotfiles to make it easier to operate with.  I wanted to have my dotfiles somewhere obvious, previously they were mixed in and embedded in the $HOME location with other files and software.  having them separated in their own directory and then using shell scripts to perform installs allows me to symlink to the dotfiles and also install any necessary software for me to operate.
